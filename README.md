# Boids Simulation

## Introduction
This Python-based project offers a dynamic and interactive simulation of bird-like entities, known as "boids", in a virtual atmospheric environment. The simulation showcases the behavior of individual boids as well as their interactions in a group.

## Forces
In this project, four fundamental forces are simulated to mimic the realistic movement of boids:

- **Drag**: The resistance force experienced by a boid moving through the air. It is calculated as:
  $$\( F_{\text{drag}} = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 C_d A \)
  where \( \rho \) is the air density, \( v \) is the velocity of the boid, \( C_d \) is the drag coefficient, and \( A \) is the frontal area.$$

- **Lift**: The upward force enabling the boid to counteract gravity. It is given by:
  \( F_{\text{lift}} = C_l \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 A \)
  where \( C_l \) is the lift coefficient.

- **Gravity**: The gravitational pull acting downwards on the boid, calculated as:
  \( F_{\text{gravity}} = m \cdot g \)
  where \( m \) is the mass of the boid and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity.

- **Flap**: The force generated by the boid to propel itself upwards and forwards. It's a function of the boid's energy exerted during the flapping motion and is modeled in relation to the boid's kinetic energy and wing-flapping dynamics.

## Demonstrations
